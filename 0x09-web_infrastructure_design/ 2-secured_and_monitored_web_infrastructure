### Explanations:
2nd Server: For redundancy and load distribution.

Load Balancer: Distributes traffic evenly across servers.

Firewalls: Block unauthorized access (ports, IPs).

HTTPS: Encrypts traffic for security.

Monitoring: Tracks performance, detects issues.

Data Collection: Agents collect metrics (CPU, memory, etc.) and send to monitoring service.

Monitor QPS: Configure monitoring to track requests per second.

### Issues:
SSL Termination at LB: Traffic between LB and servers is unencrypted.

Single Write MySQL: Primary failure stops write operations.

Identical Components: Limits specialization optimization.
