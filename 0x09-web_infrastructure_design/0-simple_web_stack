### Explanations:
Server: A computer or system that provides resources/services to other computers (clients) over a network.

Domain Name Role: Human-readable address that maps to an IP address via DNS.

www DNS Record: CNAME record that points to foobar.com (or A record pointing to 8.8.8.8).

Web Server Role: Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to application server.

Application Server Role: Executes application logic and processes dynamic content.

Database Role: Stores, manages, and retrieves application data.

Communication: Uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols over TCP/IP.

### Issues:
SPOF: Single point of failure - if server goes down, entire site is down.

Downtime during Maintenance: Need to take server offline for updates.

Scaling Limitations: Cannot handle high traffic loads.
