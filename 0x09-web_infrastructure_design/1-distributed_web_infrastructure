### Explanations:
2nd Server: For redundancy and load distribution.

Load Balancer: Distributes traffic evenly across servers.

Distribution Algorithm: Round-robin (default) - cycles through servers sequentially.

Active-Active vs Active-Passive:

Active-Active: All servers handle traffic.

Active-Passive: Backup servers only take over when primary fails.

Primary-Replica Cluster:

Primary: Handles all write operations.

Replica: Syncs with primary and handles read operations.

Difference: Application writes to primary, reads can use replica.

### Issues:
SPOFs: Load balancer, primary database.

Security Issues: No firewall, unencrypted traffic.

No Monitoring: Can't track performance/issues.
