### Explanations:
Dual Load Balancers (Active-Active HAProxy cluster)

Distributes traffic using round-robin algorithm

Provides failover capability

Web Server Tier (Multiple Nginx servers)

Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests

Serves static content

Reverse proxies to application servers

Application Server Tier (Multiple app servers)

Runs business logic

Processes dynamic content

Connects to database

Database Cluster (MySQL Primary-Replica)

Primary handles all writes

Replicas handle read queries

Automatic failover capability

Monitoring Clients (On each server)

Collect performance metrics

Send to central monitoring service

Enable alerting

Firewall (Centralized)

Filters incoming/outgoing traffic

Implements security rules

Protects all backend servers

This architecture provides:

Horizontal scaling at each layer

Redundancy for high availability

Separation of concerns

Better resource utilization

Improved fault isolation
